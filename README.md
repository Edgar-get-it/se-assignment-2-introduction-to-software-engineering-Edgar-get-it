# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software Engineering is a systematic approach to the development,operation and maintenance of a software

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? While software engineerring is a systematic approach to developing a software and involves a structural approach like designing , implementation , testing and maintenance , Traditional Programing is just the act of writing code to create softwares
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirement Analysis. Here you gather what the customer needs
2. Design . Here you design the system architecture , modules and interface .
3. Implementation . Writing the code in the chosen programming language.
4. Testing . Ensure that the program meets all the required specifics.
5. Maintenance . Ensure that the program is always user friendly.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile and Waterfall are two different models of approach to software development. Where Agile is used where there is flexibility and allowws frequent adaptation and this makes it preferrable in cases where the project requirements keep on changing with time, Whereas Waterfall is a sequential approach of faces which must be followed systematically allowing less room for changes.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. It is an important stage in software development making sure all the requiremets and needs of the user are met for a new product.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? This entails diving into distinct manageable components each with it's specific functionalities making it's maintainability, readability and reusability easy by allowing developers focus on a specific module without affecting the other.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? Software testing is one of the most crutical process in software development to ensure that the software is free from any error and performs as expected 
1. Unit testing to ensure all the units of a software work correctly
2. Integration Testing to ensure that all the modules work together as intended
3. System testing to ensure that the software system meets all the requirements
4. Acceptance testing to ensure that the software is ready and meets all the business requirements.

Version Control system
What are version control system, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Version control system is a tool in software development used to monitor and manage changes making it easier to manage and track revisions to a project.
Examples of version control system:
1. Centralized Version Control system. Uses a central server to store all versions of the project.
2. Local version control system. Maintain track of files and changes on local system
3. Distributed version control system. This enhances collaboration and improves resilience since every clone is a backup of the repository.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? a software project manager plays a critical role in guiding projects from conception to completion, ensuring that they meet their objectives and deliver value to stakeholders. Their multifaceted responsibilities require a blend of technical knowledge, management skills, and leadership qualities.
Challenges:

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Software maintenance is a critical phase in the software lifecycle, ensuring that software remains functional, reliable, and efficient over time.
Types of Maintenance 
. Corrective Maintenance. Fixing errors after software release
. Adaptive Maintenance. Adapt the software to new or changing environment
. Perfective Maintenance. Improve the software perfomance and maintenabilty without changing it's functionality
. Preventive Maintenance. Prevent future issues by addressing threats before they become big problems
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
1. Security
2. Privacy / Data protection
3. algorithmic bias and fairness
4. Accountability
5. Integrity
6. Impact on society
7. Accessibility
8. Conflict of intrest
9. User consent
